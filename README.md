üöÄ Setup
In addition to the initial setup instructions given in the assignment material, you'll have to configure the databaseConfig.js file to your personal details before use.

To configure your local database settings for the IslandFurniture project, follow these steps:

Locate the Template File:
Find the databaseConfig.template.js file in the model folder of the project.
Create Your Local Configuration File:
Copy the template file and rename the copy to databaseConfig.js.
This file is already listed in .gitignore to prevent it from being pushed to the repository.
Edit Your Local Configuration:
Open databaseConfig.js.
Replace the placeholder values with your actual database credentials. For example:
    host: "localhost",
    user: "your_username",
    password: "your_password",
    database: "islandfurniture-it07"
üöÄ Commit/Branch Etiquette
Feature Branches (feature/*):

Commit changes that are directly related to the feature you're working on.
Regularly push your commits to remote branches so teammates can see your progress. Develop Branch (dev):
Only merge feature branches that are completed and tested.
Ensure that merging your branch does not break the build. Main Branch (main):
Never commit directly to the main branch.
Commits to main should only come from approved merges of release or hotfix branches.
