This repository is dedicated to a team project for the Software Engineering Practice course at Singapore Polytechnic, Diploma in Information Technology, for the academic year 2023/2024. Our Scrum team is tasked with enhancing the IslandFurniture customer web portal, aligning our efforts with the principles of the Scrum framework.

Please note: This repository forms a part of an academic assignment for Singapore Polytechnic. All materials and related assets within this repository are the intellectual property of Singapore Polytechnic.

🚀 Setup
In addition to the initial setup instructions given in the assignment material, you'll have to configure the databaseConfig.js file to your personal details before use.

To configure your local database settings for the IslandFurniture project, follow these steps:

Locate the Template File:
Find the databaseConfig.template.js file in the model folder of the project.
Create Your Local Configuration File:
Copy the template file and rename the copy to databaseConfig.js.
This file is already listed in .gitignore to prevent it from being pushed to the repository.
Edit Your Local Configuration:
Open databaseConfig.js.
Replace the placeholder values with your actual database credentials. For example:
    host: "localhost",
    user: "your_username",
    password: "your_password",
    database: "islandfurniture-it07"
🚀 Commit/Branch Etiquette
Feature Branches (feature/*):

Commit changes that are directly related to the feature you're working on.
Regularly push your commits to remote branches so teammates can see your progress. Develop Branch (dev):
Only merge feature branches that are completed and tested.
Ensure that merging your branch does not break the build. Main Branch (main):
Never commit directly to the main branch.
Commits to main should only come from approved merges of release or hotfix branches.
